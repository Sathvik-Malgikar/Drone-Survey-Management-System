# Drone Survey Management System

A scalable platform for planning, managing, and monitoring autonomous drone surveys across multiple global sites. This system enables large organizations to coordinate drone missions remotely and intelligently for facility inspections, security patrols, and site mapping operations.

## 🚁 Overview

This project focuses on the mission management and reporting aspects of drone operations, providing a comprehensive solution for:

- **Mission Planning**: Define survey areas, flight paths, and data collection parameters
- **Fleet Management**: Monitor drone inventory and real-time status across organizations
- **Mission Monitoring**: Track real-time flight progress with map visualization
- **Survey Analytics**: Generate comprehensive reports and analytics

> **Note**: Live video feeds, actual data collection (images/videos), and map/model generation are outside the project scope.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Mission Planning and Configuration
- Define survey areas and flight paths
- Configure flight altitudes, waypoints, and routes
- Set data collection parameters (frequency, sensors)
- Support for advanced survey patterns (crosshatch, perimeter)
- Mission-specific parameter configuration (altitude, overlap percentage)

### 📊 Fleet Visualization and Management Dashboard
- Organization-wide drone inventory display
- Real-time drone status monitoring (available, in-mission)
- Battery levels and vital statistics tracking
- Fleet coordination across multiple sites

### 🗺️ Real-time Mission Monitoring Interface
- Interactive map visualization of drone flight paths
- Mission progress tracking (% complete, ETA)
- Live mission status updates (starting, in progress, completed, aborted)
- Mission control actions (pause, resume, abort)

### 📈 Survey Reporting and Analytics Portal
- Comprehensive survey summaries
- Individual flight statistics (duration, distance, coverage)
- Organization-wide survey analytics
- Historical mission data and trends
